# PIN

Ground up rework because the routing got insane on the other project. This one looks simple enough. Using Vite now. Starting to implement the styling. Didn't really finish, but I'm slowly bringing things over from the original project, I think this will work in small chunks, espically now so that the routing isn't nearly as complicated. Everything is mocked right now.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
